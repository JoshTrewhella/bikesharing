# bikesharing
## Project Overview
We've been tasked with a project to voncince investors to invest in a bike sharing program. We used existing bike data from New York to analyze how our business model will work and its profitability. 

We used Panda in Python to prepare the data and Tableau to create these [sheets and story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZS3NRDD2C?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
