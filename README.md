# bikesharing
## Project Overview
We've been tasked with a project to voncince investors to invest in a bike sharing program. We used existing bike data from New York to analyze how our business model will work and its profitability. 

We used Panda in Python to prepare the data and Tableau to create these [sheets and story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZS3NRDD2C?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Analysis

## Summary
We can see from our analysis that males were the most common customer we can expect for bike rides.

Based on the common times on our heatmap (6-9AM and 5-7PM), it could be that our bikes will be used most commonly for commuting purposes to and from work. 

I would suggest additionally including Birth Year in our existing analysis to have a deeper understanding of our customer base and what our service will be used for. We could also use User Type and Birth Year to see if there is a correlation with older or younger customers subcribing to our service.
